# Changelog

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-28 - Smaller fixes

### Added

- Dual-antenna GNSS heading post-processing: new `heading.csv` file format.
- `config.yaml` option `imu: mount_rpy_deg`: the sensor board's attitude in the
  body frame, corrects at once accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer
  attitude (without the need to set individual misalignment matrices).
- Range aiding to known anchors (no full tight coupling yet though).

### Changed

- `inspostgui.py` several small tweaks and bug fixes to improve quality of life.
- Post-processing: `score: leverarm_frd` fixed: a reference taken at the GNSS
  antenna no longer shows the lever arm as a height or position offset.
- Post-processing PDF output: The North-East map marks the start and end of the
  estimated track.

### Fixed

- `nav_suite`: the local-height/GNSS offset filter was fed the antenna's
  ellipsoid height against the IMU's local height, so it absorbed the
  vertical GNSS lever arm.
- `ins` auto-init bootstrapped the IMU at the GNSS antenna's position. It
  now starts at the fix minus the lever arm rotated with the bootstrap
  attitude (only its vertical part while the yaw is unknown).
- `ins` re-acquisition after an expired coasting window rotated the lever
  arm with the attitude frozen at the start of the outage.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-13 - Automotive Update

### Added

- Non-holonomic lateral velocity constraint for automotive mode during GNSS
  outages: cars typically don't move sideways at a high velocity, so this
  constraint bounds attitude/velocity drift while GNSS is unavailable.
  Example dataset: `datasets/tunnel_nhc`.
- Magnetic model safety: dip pole exclusion zones added to the World Magnetic
  Model lookup, since declination/inclination become unreliable close to the
  dip poles.
- `make stack`: static worst-case stack usage analysis added.
- `tools/inslib_speed_scale.py`: calibrate odometry speed from OBD2 dongles
  against GNSS speed.
- KML export: raw GNSS fix track added, MSL altitude (with geoid undulation),
  and a 3D attitude model for Google Earth playback.
- OpenStreetMap view for `inspostgui.py` added.
- `tools/inslib_imu_calib.py` (renamed from `inslib_ubx_imu_calib.py`):
  command line IMU/magnetometer calibration from `.csv` recordings of any
  IMU (`--csv`), no sensor board needed.
- Replay `config.yaml`: `mag.bias_init_ut` and `mag.bias_rw_ut_sqrts` expose
  the two hard-iron tuning knobs of the 18-state mode, so a dataset can state
  how much hard iron the filter should expect and how long the estimate keeps
  listening. Both default to the library values when absent.

### Performance compared to v1.0.0

- ~12% fewer instructions in the time critical Kalman update path.
- More than 30% reduction in worst-case stack memory usage.
- GNSS processing costs about half of what it did on a ARM Cortex-M4F MCU.

### Changed

- **API break:** `x_ecef`/`xdot_ecef` in `ins_init_t`
  are replaced by `llh` (latitude and longitude in rad,
  height over the WGS84 ellipsoid) and `vel_ned`.
- **API break:** `xyz_ecef` in `ins_meas_gnss_pos_t` is replaced by `llh`, the
  form receivers report and the filter fuses in. An ECEF-native source can
  convert with `ins_ecef_to_latlonh()`. In the Python binding,
  `Navigator.gnss_pos()` becomes `gnss_pos_llh()`.
- Post-Processing: Warn if magnetometer `.csv` data is present in a dataset but
  no WMM year is set in `config.yaml`.

### Security

- Added `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability disclosure policy) and `sbom.cdx.json`
  (CycloneDX software bill of materials) for EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

### Fixed

- WMM: fixed a +/-180 degree declination wraparound bug in the interpolation.
- Fixed a YAML parser bug affecting vector definitions.
- `inslib_convert_ubx_to_csv.py`: fixed OBD2 speed odometry data export and
  post-processing.
- GNSS state machine exit criteria: coasting time is no longer counted
  against the bad-fix-time threshold.
- `inslib_decimate_dataset.py`: sampling rate is now derived correctly when
  the recording has gaps, instead of just total time span / sample count.
- `inslib_convert_ubx_to_csv.py`: no longer hardcodes a generic MEMS baro
  standard deviation guess, uses the library default instead.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-09
