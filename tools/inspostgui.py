"""inspostgui -- INSLIB post-processing GUI.

Interactive Qt front end for tools/replay.py: open a config YAML of a
converted dataset (the "project file": it sits in a directory with the
dataset-neutral CSVs, contract: datasets/replay_format.py, and names them
through its optional inputs: section, so one directory can carry e.g. a
config.yaml next to a config_experimental.yaml), inspect/edit/create it,
replay it through the ins filter (in-process, on the replay core
replay.py runs on, tools/replay_core.py, so every input stream, the feed
order, the scoring and the summary are the same) and evaluate the
result:

* live 3D trajectory view with a speed-colored trail, ground-truth
  overlay, GNSS fix dots, the previous run of the same dataset as a grey
  ghost trail (all switchable) and an attitude-driven vehicle model /
  error ellipsoid (visualization lifted from znav3d),
* live attitude / position / altitude / acceleration panels,
* post-run error plots (estimate vs. ground truth with the filter's own
  1-sigma band), a North-East map view, bias convergence and outlier
  counters,
* a Map tab: the same track over an optional OpenStreetMap background
  (tiles cached on disk and shared with inslib_gui.py's Track tab),
* the same accuracy / data-quality summary replay.py prints,
* a simulated GNSS outage (toolbar field, start:duration windows in
  seconds from the first IMU sample), the same cut as replay.py
  --gnss-outage,
* multi-page PDF export via ins_plots and Google Earth KML export via
  ins_kml,
* a dark and a light colour theme (toolbar, or --theme), same palettes
  as inslib_gui.py, see ins_gui_theme.py.

The config editor loads the dataset's config.yaml into a form (the
replay.py/replay.c schema minus the score.lim_* regression gates, which
are CI-only knobs for `make datasets`/`make simulated` and not
meaningful for interactive GUI use), can create a config for a dataset
directory that has none yet, and preserves keys it does not know about
(e.g. the foreign origin:/crazyflie: sections and the score.lim_* gates
themselves) when saving. NOTE: YAML comments are lost on save -- prefer
"Save As" for generated configs.

Usage:
    make pylib
    python3 tools/inspostgui.py
    python3 tools/inspostgui.py datasets/simulated/profile_1_car
    python3 tools/inspostgui.py datasets/fog/config.yaml
    python3 tools/inspostgui.py --theme light
    python3 tools/inspostgui.py --batch datasets/simulated/profile_1_car

--batch replays the dataset headless (no window) and prints the summary,
it exists mainly as a smoke test of the replay worker. --gnss-outage
START:DURATION (repeatable) applies the outage cut there.

Dependencies (pip install -r python/requirements.txt):
PyQt6, pyqtgraph, PyOpenGL, numpy, PyYAML. Optional: matplotlib (PDF
export), simplekml (KML export), numpy-stl (3D vehicle model, a simple
box is drawn without it).
