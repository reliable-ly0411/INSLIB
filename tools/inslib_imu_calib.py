"""IMU calibration without a fixture, live from the sensor board or from CSV.

Records one continuous session in which the unit is put down in a number
of arbitrary static poses with rotations in between, then solves for the
accelerometer and gyroscope calibration and writes the REQ-NAV-037 keys
into a config.yaml that tools/insrcv.c --config and python/replay.py
consume directly:

    imu:
      acc_misalignment: [...]   # col-major 3x3, corrected = M*(raw-bias)
      gyr_misalignment: [...]   # col-major 3x3, same model
      acc_fixed_bias: [...]     # [m/s^2]
      gyr_fixed_bias: [...]     # [rad/s]

When the board also streams a magnetometer (0x40/0x06) the same recording
calibrates that too, into the REQ-NAV-039 keys:

    mag:
      misalignment: [...]       # col-major 3x3, soft iron + alignment
      fixed_bias: [...]         # hard iron [uT]

The method is imu_tk's (Tedaldi/Pretto/Menegatti, ICRA 2014); the maths
lives in inslib_imu_tk.py, which also explains why it needs no known
orientations: the accelerometer cost is |g| - ||M*(a-b)||, a magnitude,
so where a pose points never enters it. Put the unit down anywhere, leave
it for a few seconds, pick it up, turn it, put it down again. The static
periods are detected from a rolling variance and the one threshold
involved is swept and resolved by residual, so there is nothing to tune.

This replaces the 6-position tumble test that used to live here. That
method estimates the bias as (up+down)/2 per axis pair, which is exact
only when the two halves of a pair are exactly opposite one another: an
independent 1 deg placement error on each position puts ~0.11 m/s^2 into
the accelerometer bias, more than the bias of a decent MEMS part. It also
could not calibrate the gyroscope beyond its bias, for want of a rate
table. This one gets gyro scale and full misalignment from the same
recording, because between two static poses the accelerometer knows both
gravity directions and the integrated gyro has to carry one onto the
other.

What is measured:

  * Accelerometer misalignment, scale and bias: 9 parameters, fitted over
    every static pose in the session.
  * Gyroscope misalignment and scale: 9 parameters, fitted over the
    rotations between consecutive poses. Its bias comes from the initial
    rest period.
  * IMU noise (gyr_psd/acc_psd): from the initial rest period, as
    sigma^2 * dt (the per-sample convention replay.py's noise check
    uses). Only written when the config has no value yet.
  * Magnetometer hard iron, soft iron and the mounting rotation onto the
    IMU triad, when the board streams one. The maths and the reasoning
    are in inslib_mag_calib.py and inslib_frame_align.py: the turns
    between the poses give the field cloud its coverage, and the static
    poses give the alignment, so the session needs nothing added to it.

The housing alignment (where the IMU sits inside the BOX, as opposed to
where the sensor sits on the board) needs the unit placed on a level
surface face by face, which is a guided procedure rather than a recording:
tools/inslib_calib_gui.py has it.

The IMU temperature over the whole session is recorded and written as a
comment together with the date: MEMS biases drift with temperature, so
the calibration is only valid near that range.

If the output config.yaml already exists it is merged: the imu
calibration keys are replaced, everything else (and an existing tuned
noise model) is preserved. Merging needs PyYAML; hand-written comments
in the old file are regenerated, not kept.

Usage:
    python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --port COM4
    python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --udp 29801        # hub fan-out
    python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --port COM4 --duration 240
    python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --csv mysession/   # offline

--csv solves a session that was recorded some other way, from any IMU,
as replay-format CSV files (imu.csv, optionally mag.csv, see
load_csv_recording). It follows the same procedure: rest period first,
then poses with rotations in between.

--udp reads the stream from tools/inslib_hub.py's fan-out instead of
opening the serial port, so a running session keeps recording and feeding
insrcv while the unit is being calibrated (see UdpSource).

tools/inslib_calib_gui.py is a graphical front end for the same
measurement and solve code in this file.

Requires pyserial and numpy. PyYAML only when merging into an existing
config. Framing is UbxFramer from inslib_ubx.py, like every other tool
here: pyubx2's stream reader must not be pointed at this stream (see that
module's docstring, and the note on ImuStream below).
