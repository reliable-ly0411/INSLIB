"""Convert a sensor-board .ubx capture (see inslib_protocol.md) into the
INSLIB datasets replay format (config.yaml + CSVs, contract in
datasets/replay_format.py). Turns a recorded session into a dataset that
tools/replay.c and python/replay.py can score, with ref.csv and a fuller
config.yaml (automotive mode, score section) matching the
datasets/convert_*.py dataset layout.

Outputs (written to --outdir):
  - imu.csv, baro.csv, mag.csv
                  straight from the firmware's own class-0x40
                  messages (0x40/0x01, 0x40/0x02, 0x40/0x06) --
                  framing/checksum via inslib_ubx.py, the payload decode
                  is local (pyubx2 has no definition for this vendor
                  class). mag.csv is only written when the capture
                  actually carried magnetometer frames, and `mag: enable`
                  in the generated config.yaml follows the same fact:
                  the replay harnesses fail on `enable` without a file.
  - speed.csv     absolute ground speed from the host-produced odometry
                  frames (0x40/0x80, e.g. tools/inslib_obd_speed.py via
                  tools/inslib_hub.py). Only frames the hub already
                  stamped with an MCU t_us are convertible: the replay
                  format has one timebase and there is nothing here to
                  map a bare host clock onto. Written, and `speed:
                  enable` set, only when the capture carries such frames.
  - gnss.csv      from the passed-through receiver's NAV-PVT + NAV-COV
                  (0x01/0x07, 0x01/0x36) -- decoded with pyubx2 from
                  already checksum-verified frames. Only epochs with
                  fixType >= --min-fix-type are kept.
  - heading.csv   dual-antenna heading from the receiver's NAV-RELPOSNED
                  (0x01/0x3C) in u-blox moving base mode: the azimuth of
                  the base-to-rover antenna baseline, its accHeading 1-sigma
                  and carrSoln. Only epochs the receiver itself vouches for
                  are kept (gnssFixOK, relPosValid, relPosHeadingValid) and
                  only in moving base mode (isMoving): against a static RTK
                  base the same field is the direction to that base station,
                  not an attitude. Stamped with the t_us of the NAV-PVT of
                  the same iTOW (plus the iTOW difference when the two
                  belong to different epochs), so a heading row and the
                  gnss.csv fix of its epoch carry the identical t_us.
                  Written, and `heading: enable` set, only when the capture
                  carries such epochs.
  - ref.csv       MVP placeholder: this tool has no independent ground
                  truth, so ref.csv is just the GNSS solution again (same
                  lat/lon/h/v_ned as gnss.csv) with roll/pitch/yaw
                  hardcoded to 0/0/0. Scoring ins position against this
                  ref.csv is close to circular (ins would be aided by the
                  same GNSS) and the attitude is not a real reference --
                  see the RAWX/SFRBX paragraph below for the planned fix.
                  config.yaml disables AHRS/ARS attitude scoring
                  accordingly (score: ahrs: 0).
  - config.yaml   replay configuration for tools/replay.c and
                  python/replay.py. Only written if the file does not
                  exist yet, so a hand-tuned config survives a re-run.
                  `mag: wmm_year` comes from the UTC date of the first
                  dated NAV-PVT: the replay harnesses build no reference
                  field without an epoch, and without one every
                  magnetometer sample is rejected. `speed: scale` is
                  fitted against gnss.csv's own velocity by
                  tools/inslib_speed_scale.py (used here as a library)
                  whenever that fit clears its own trust bar -- see
                  calibrate_speed_scale() below -- and left at the
                  library default (0.0 -> 1.0) with a comment explaining
                  why otherwise, never a number this tool cannot vouch for.
                  `automotive_mode` defaults to whatever this capture is:
                  on when it carries odometry, off otherwise -- a wheel/OBD
                  speed source is itself evidence of a road vehicle.
                  --automotive-mode/--no-automotive-mode overrides this.

Not produced yet (left as planned features -- see the comments at the
call sites below for where to hook them in):
  - A real, independent ref.csv: the receiver's RXM-RAWX (0x02/0x15) and
    RXM-SFRBX (0x02/0x13) passthrough messages carry raw pseudorange/
    carrier-phase observations and broadcast ephemeris -- everything
    a post-processing tool (e.g. RTKLIB's rnx2rtkp) needs for a
    post-processed (or at least a second, independent single-receiver)
    solution. Both already arrive at the pyubx2 decode step below
    (identity RXM-RAWX/RXM-SFRBX) but are only counted, not acted on.
    Once wired up: capture them into a RINEX obs/nav file (or RTCM3),
    run the post-processor, and write the result to ref.csv instead of
    the gnss.csv passthrough -- ideally against a nearby base station
    for an RTK-quality independent ground truth. The attitude
    columns would still need a real IMU-independent source (none exists
    yet); until then keep them at 0/0/0 or leave score:ahrs disabled.

Timebase: only the firmware's own class-0x40 messages carry the local
t_us clock (u64 microseconds since power-up, monotonic, never unwrapped
here -- inslib_protocol.md "Timebase"). NAV-PVT/NAV-COV do not, so each
GNSS epoch is stamped with the most recently seen IMU t_us. That folds the
USB/processing/passthrough latency into the fix time; config.yaml's
`gnss: delay_ms` is where that gets compensated at replay time
(REQ-VER-008). Absolute time comes from the 0x40/0x05 time sync frames,
which the firmware has already paired with the receiver's TIM-TP
announcement; --pos fits a linear clock model to them (see ClockFit).
