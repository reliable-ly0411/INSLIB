    a mismatch between them (e.g. the ARS's own velocity-blind fallback
    considers the platform still while ins's position-aided detector
    doesn't, because ins has no GNSS lock yet) is visible directly.

    ins auto-ZUPT/ZARU: ins's own detector, velocity-aware (uses ins's
    estimated velocity, GNSS-informed when available), needs ins ready
    (position aiding), REQ-SUITE-009/-010.

    ARS/AHRS ZARU applied: the ARS's and AHRS's own last-epoch "did a

    ahrs_zaru_applied, REQ-AHRS-024), OR'd together into one row. NOT
    ars_auto_zaru_active/ahrs_auto_zaru_active -- that pair is only a
    loose "stillness run started" gate that stays true through genuine
    constant-velocity cruise (can't tell that from a stop, velocity-
    blind), well before the stricter windowed-variance criterion and
    dwell time this row actually requires. This row already includes
    whatever ins relayed down to the ARS/AHRS (nav_suite's zaru_active()/
    last_zaru_trigger, src/nav_suite.c:594), so it is always >= the ins
    row above -- the interesting part is where it goes true WITHOUT ins.

    baro_alt vertical ZUPT: whatever zero-velocity update actually reached
    baro_alt's vertical filter this epoch (REQ-SUITE-015) -- baro_alt has
    no stillness detector of its own (see baro_alt_zero_velocity_update,
    src/baro_alt.c:628). It is exactly the OR of the two rows above (ins
