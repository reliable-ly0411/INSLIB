"""Python replay of the datasets datasets through INS, with optional live
telemetry (PlotJuggler JSON via --plotjuggler and/or MAVLink via --mavlink,
both off by default).

This is the visualization/telemetry counterpart to the C harness
(tools/replay.c — that one is the regression evaluation tool for
`make datasets`). Both consume the same dataset directory: a generated
config.yaml plus the dataset-neutral CSVs (imu/ref/gnss/mag/baro.csv,
see datasets/replay_format.py). replay.py drives the same INS
filter via the ctypes wrapper.

Usage:
    make pylib
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset  # dir
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset/config.yaml
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset --realtime
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset --plotjuggler
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset --mavlink
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset --plot
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset \\
        --plot --plot-out /tmp/plots.pdf  # save a multi-page PDF instead
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset \\
        --kml /tmp/flight.kml           # Google Earth output
    python3 python/replay.py datasets/some/dataset \\
        --map-frames /tmp/frames        # OpenStreetMap PNG frame sequence

--plot draws the filter's state history (position/velocity/attitude) with
a 1-σ band from its own error-state covariance, the ground truth overlaid on
top, and (reference from ref.csv) an error-vs-truth plot with
the same band as a consistency check. Also included: a North-East position (map
view) page drawn from a separate, faster ground-track recorder
(--plot-track-hz) and thinned to the scale of the view rather than to a fixed
sample count, a dedicated altitude-profile page
(INSLIB/baro_alt/ground-truth/raw GNSS together), the INSLIB/ARS/AHRS bias
pages (mag hard-iron bias too, 18-state mode), an outlier-rejection page, the
cumulative chi2-downweight counters per sub-filter over time, and a sensor
sampling-rate page, each input stream's Hz bucketed over time (bucket width
--plot-rate-bucket-sec).

--kml writes a Google Earth KMZ (see ins_kml.py): the estimate as a
time-animated gx:Track (drag Google Earth's time slider to fly the replay)
with a small 3D model banking/pitching along the real roll/pitch/yaw, plus
static ground-track lines for the estimate (draped down to the ground so
climbs/descents are visible), the ground truth and the raw GNSS fix.

--map-frames writes a portrait PNG frame sequence (see ins_map_frames.py):
raw GNSS fix and INSLIB estimate revealed over time on an OpenStreetMap
background, with a band marking the real tunnel/underpass geometry pulled
from the Overpass API -- meant for a stretch of a drive a Google Earth
flyover cannot show (no hollow tunnel interior there). Prints the ffmpeg
command to stitch the frames into a video; does not run ffmpeg itself.

The GNSS-delay estimate cross-correlates baro_alt's own
down-velocity (assumed ~zero latency) against the held GNSS down-velocity
to estimate the fix's processing/telemetry latency, printed at the end -
a way to find a value for config `gnss: delay_ms` instead of
guessing it. Runs automatically whenever it would be meaningful (aiding:
gnss with usable velocity, plus a barometer), --estimate-gnss-delay forces
it on for other cases (e.g. a sanity check against aiding: ref, which
should come out near 0 ms since the fix is synthesized from the same
reference used for scoring). Needs a trial with real vertical motion
(climbs/descents) to give a meaningful (not just noise-fit) correlation
peak.

Requires the converted dataset (datasets/), PyYAML,
pymavlink for --mavlink, matplotlib for --plot, simplekml for --kml
(plus optional pyproj for its real-altitude geoid correction), and
matplotlib/Pillow for --map-frames (plus network access for its
OpenStreetMap tiles and tunnel geometry -- degrades gracefully without).
--estimate-gnss-delay needs no extra dependency.

    deg tilt error already implies ~0.17 m/s^2 of phantom accel, vs. a

    acc_psd white noise plus gyr_bias_rw/acc_bias_rw random walk) -
    independent of any particular replay/filter run, a pure function of the
    noise model.

    Attitude has no process-noise coupling FROM anywhere else (see
    _rate_state_growth_var) - driven by gyro white noise + gyro bias random
    walk, no feedback from velocity/position in ins_compute_Phi. It DOES,
    however, feed velocity/position: besides their own direct accel-noise/
    accel-bias path (_rate_state_growth_var/_position_state_growth_var),
    ins_compute_Phi couples them to the (independently growing) attitude
    error via the specific-force cross product - gravity leaking through a

    _tilt_coupled_velocity_growth_var/_tilt_coupled_position_growth_var for
    that derivation; modeled for the horizontal channel (worse case than
    vertical, which has no tilt coupling under level flight), matching the
    isotropic acc_var/gyr_var simplification used elsewhere in this file.

    On top of all of the above, ins.c ALWAYS adds its own extra process-
    noise margin directly to pos/vel/rpy (config.yaml's imu: pos/vel/
    rpy_pred_stddev_*_sqrts) - it enters each state's OWN derivative
    exactly like a direct sensor-noise term (n=1 in
    _integrated_white_noise_var's terms), so it folds additively into
    q1_acc (vel's direct-noise level) and q1_gyr (attitude's), and once
    folded in there it correctly rides along through the same tilt-coupling
    math into velocity/position too; pos gets its own extra term directly
    (nothing downstream depends on position, so it doesn't propagate
    further).

    Returns None if any of pos/vel/rpy_pred_stddev_*_sqrts is left at 0 in
    `noise` - that means the dataset defers to ins.c's own built-in
    default (INS_DEFAULT_POS/VEL/RPY_PRED_STDDEV_*), and this module

    around it: a second, python-side copy of a C #define is exactly the
    kind of thing that silently goes stale the day someone tunes the C
    default and forgets this file exists (this whole function originally
    shipped broken for exactly that class of reason - see
    tests/test_growth_rate.py). Set the three fields explicitly in
    config.yaml's imu: section to get an estimate here.

    None of these are constant slopes in the strict calculus sense (σ
    grows with sqrt(t)/t^1.5, not linearly) - "growth rate" here means the
    AVERAGE rate over `horizon_sec` (σ(horizon)/horizon), which is why

    can be replayed without a conversion step. A converter may instead

    the producer's own per-sample columns stay in the file as a record of
    what it measured, and can be promoted to inputs later if a dataset
    ever needs them to vary.

    Rows without an MCU timestamp are dropped: they arrived before the
