"""Shared writers for the dataset-neutral replay format (REQ-VER-003).

Every converted dataset directory carries the same files, consumed by
both tools/replay.c and python/replay.py:

  config.yaml  lever arms, IMU noise model + optional IMU/magnetometer
               calibration (misalignment/fixed bias, REQ-NAV-037/039),
               aiding/init mode, optional GNSS covariance conditioning
               (scale/floor, REQ-NAV-038), warmup, regression limits (flat
               two-level YAML subset -- the C harness parses only sections
               + scalar/inline-list values). An optional `inputs:` section
               overrides the CSV filenames below per stream (imu/ref/gnss/
               mag/baro/speed/heading), each relative to config.yaml's directory -- unset
               keeps the conventional <stream>.csv name, so one stream can
               be swapped (e.g. gnss: gnss_f9p.csv) with the rest shared.
  imu.csv      t_us, gyr_frd_xyz [rad/s], acc_frd_xyz [m/s^2], and
               optionally imu_temp_c [degC] (see IMU_HEADER_TEMP)
  ref.csv      t_us, lat_deg, lon_deg, h_m, roll/pitch/yaw [deg], v_ned
  gnss.csv     t_us, lat_deg, lon_deg, h_m, full NED position covariance
               (nn,ne,nd,ee,ed,dd) [m^2], v_ned [m/s], full NED velocity
               covariance (nn,ne,nd,ee,ed,dd) [(m/s)^2], vel_ok.
               Zero diagonal entries mean "unknown" and are replaced by
               the config fallback stddevs at replay time.
  mag.csv      t_us, mag_frd_xyz [uT]                (optional)
  baro.csv     t_us, static pressure [Pa]            (optional)
  speed.csv    t_us, scalar ground speed [m/s]      (optional)
  heading.csv  t_us, baseline azimuth [deg], its 1-sigma [deg], carr_soln
               (0 none, 1 float, 2 fixed)             (optional)
               The azimuth of the body-fixed antenna baseline as the
               receiver measured it (u-blox moving base NAV-RELPOSNED
               relPosHeading), NOT yet the vehicle yaw: the harnesses turn
               it into one with config.yaml's heading: baseline_frd and
               the current roll/pitch (REQ-NAV-087), so a remounted
               antenna pair is a config edit, not a reconversion. A row
               of the same epoch as a gnss.csv fix carries the identical
               t_us, which is what links the two files. Trailing columns
               (baseline length, receiver iTOW) are the producer's own
               record, both harnesses read the first four only.

Converters import these helpers so the format cannot drift apart.
