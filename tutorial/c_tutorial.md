# INSLIB in C

INSLIB is a small, portable navigation-filter library written in C11. It
fuses an IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope) with other aiding sensors -
GNSS, a magnetometer, a barometer, or an indoor position system such as
Lighthouse / UWB / motion capture - into one estimate of **where you are**
and **which way you are pointing**.

This tutorial gets you from nothing to a running solution in one file of
plain C. No prior Kalman-filter knowledge is assumed.

## What you get

The core filter (`INS`) is a **15-state error-state Kalman filter (ESKF)**.
"15 states" means it continuously estimates:

| States | Quantity | Frame |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 0–2    | position | local NED (north-east-down) |
| 3–5    | velocity | NED |
| 6–8    | attitude (roll/pitch/yaw error) | body → NED |
| 9–11   | accelerometer bias | body |
| 12–14  | gyroscope bias | body |

You do not touch those internals. You feed measurements in and read a
position/velocity/attitude solution out.

## Design in one breath

* **No heap, no OS.** The whole filter is one caller-owned `struct`
  (`ins_t`). You zero it, initialise it, and feed it. It never calls
  `malloc`. That is what makes it a drop-in library for microcontrollers.
* **Conventions.** Body frame is **FRD** (x forward, y right, z down),
  navigation frame is **NED**. Quaternions are Hamilton with `q[0] = w`.
  Timestamps are `int64` microseconds. Angles are radians.
* **You only set what you care about.** Almost every configuration field
  treats `0` as "pick a sensible default", so a zeroed options struct
  already gives you a working (but not optimal) filter.

## Your first program

Here is a complete program. It creates a filter, feeds it three seconds of
a (stationary, level) IMU at 100 Hz with a once-per-second GNSS fix, and
prints the resulting position and attitude.

```c
/* hello_ins.c - minimal INSLIB example: fuse a stationary IMU with a
 * GNSS position fix and print the navigation solution. */
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "ins.h"
#include "geodetic_toolbox.h"

int main(void)
{
    /* 1. The filter lives in one caller-owned struct. Zero it first. */
    ins_t ins = {0};

    /* Example data: a random spot in Munich, 520 m ellipsoidal. The
     * filter works in a local NED frame, this is where its origin sits. */
    const double lat = DEG2RAD(48.1372), lon = DEG2RAD(11.5756), h = 520.0;

    /* 2. Initial values and noise assumptions. Zeros pick sane consumer
     *    MEMS defaults, so we only set what we care about. The position fixes the
     *    local-frame origin (a coarse guess is fine - auto_init refines the
     *    solution from the first real fix).
     *    Initial position is has 5 m precision, initial velocity is zero
     *    with a precision of 1 m/s, initial roll/pitch/yaw is 5° deg precise.
     */
    ins_init_t init = {0};
    init.llh[0] = lat;
    init.llh[1] = lon;
    init.llh[2] = h;
    init.pos_init_stddev_m = 5.0f; /* [m]   trust the first fix ~5 m  */
    init.vel_init_stddev_mps = 1.0f; /* [m/s] trust in init. velocity */
    init.rpy_init_stddev_rad[0] = DEG2RAD(5.0f);
    init.rpy_init_stddev_rad[1] = DEG2RAD(5.0f);
    init.rpy_init_stddev_rad[2] = DEG2RAD(5.0f);

    /* 3. Options. auto_init lets the filter bootstrap its start time, level
     *    (roll/pitch) and position from the first coherent IMU+GNSS it sees.
     *    Everything left at 0 falls back to best-effort reasonable defaults.
     *    But check the details, often the default is not good enough.
     */
    ins_options_t opt = {0};
    opt.auto_init = true;

    if (ins_init(&ins, &init, &opt) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "ins_init failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    /* 4. Feed measurements. 100 Hz IMU for 6 s, a 1 Hz GNSS fix on top.
     *    At rest and level the accelerometer measures specific force
     *    f = -g: in body FRD (z down) that is +g pointing "up" == -z. */
    const float dt = 0.01f; /* 100 Hz */
    for (int k = 1; k <= 600; ++k) {
        ins_time_us_t t_us = (ins_time_us_t)(1.0 * 1e6 * k * dt);

        ins_measurements_t m = {0};
        m.timestamp        = t_us;
        m.strapdown_dt_sec = dt;

        m.acc.is_valid = true;
        m.acc.data[0]  = 0.0f;
        m.acc.data[1]  = 0.0f;
        m.acc.data[2]  = -9.81f; /* specific force at rest, FRD */

        m.gyr.is_valid = true;
        m.gyr.data[0]  = 0.0f;
        m.gyr.data[1]  = 0.0f;
        m.gyr.data[2]  = 0.0f;

        /* GNSS once per second: position + a diagonal NED covariance
         * (here 2 m horizontal, 4 m vertical 1-sigma -> variance in m^2).
         * The fix goes in as the receiver reports it, latitude, longitude
         * and height, which is the form the filter fuses in. A source that
         * is natively ECEF converts once with ins_ecef_to_latlonh(). */
        if (k % 100 == 0) {
            m.gnss_pos.is_valid   = true;
            m.gnss_pos.llh[0]     = lat;
            m.gnss_pos.llh[1]     = lon;
            m.gnss_pos.llh[2]     = h;
            m.gnss_pos.Qll_ned[0] = 2.0f * 2.0f; /* var N */
            m.gnss_pos.Qll_ned[4] = 2.0f * 2.0f; /* var E */
            m.gnss_pos.Qll_ned[8] = 4.0f * 4.0f; /* var D */
        }

        ins_update(&ins, &m);
    }

    /* 5. Read the solution. */
    if (!ins_is_ready(&ins)) {
        printf("filter still warming up\n");
        return 0;
    }

    double llh[3];
    float  roll, pitch, yaw;
    ins_get_latlonh(&ins, llh); /* lat [rad], lon [rad], h over the ellipsoid */
    ins_get_rpy(&ins, &roll, &pitch, &yaw);

    printf("position : lat %.6f deg  lon %.6f deg  h %.1f m\n",
           llh[0] / D2R, llh[1] / D2R, llh[2]);
    printf("attitude : roll %.2f  pitch %.2f  yaw %.2f deg\n",
           roll / D2R, pitch / D2R, yaw / D2R);
    return 0;
}
```

### Build and run

INSLIB has no build-system dependency, just compile its `.c` files
alongside your project. From the repository root:

```sh
cc -std=c11 -D_GNU_SOURCE \
   -Isrc -IKFCore/c -IKFCore/c/navigation_tools \
   hello_ins.c \
   src/ins.c src/geodetic_toolbox.c src/magnetic_model.c \
   KFCore/c/linalg.c KFCore/c/kalman_udu.c KFCore/c/miniblas.c \
   -lm -o hello_ins
./hello_ins
```

Expected output:

```
position : lat 48.137200 deg  lon 11.575600 deg  h 520.0 m
attitude : roll -0.01  pitch 0.00  yaw 0.02 deg
```

The position matches the fix and the attitude comes out level, the filter
levelled itself from the accelerometer during warm-up.

## The three calls you actually use

Everything in the example reduces to a tiny loop:

1. **`ins_init(&ins, &init, &opt)`** - once, after zeroing the struct.
2. **`ins_update(&ins, &m)`** - once per epoch, with a filled
   `ins_measurements_t`.
3. **`ins_get_*` / `ins_is_ready`** - read the answer whenever you want it.

`ins_measurements_t` is a bundle: set the whole struct to `{0}` and fill
in only the fields you have this epoch. Each sub-measurement has an
`is_valid` flag, the filter consumes exactly the ones you flag. Missing a
sensor for an epoch is normal - just leave it invalid.

### Warm-up

`ins_is_ready()` returns `false` until the filter has levelled and had a
run of good fixes (a few seconds). Read the solution only once it is
`true`. With `auto_init` enabled the filter bootstraps itself from the
first coherent IMU+fix pair, you do not have to hand it an accurate
initial attitude or position. Only the heading can be tricky, if there
is no magnetometer, a GNSS+IMU system with a wrong heading will produce
nonsense data until enough movement allows the system to converge.

The fixes have to be good enough for a 3D solution, which is stricter
than being good enough to fuse: the entry gate
(`opt.gnss_start_max_*`, by default 2 m horizontal / 3 m vertical
position and 0.25 m/s velocity 1-sigma) must hold for
`opt.gnss_init_dwell_sec`. If your receiver reports a coarser accuracy
than that, raise the entry gate - otherwise the filter keeps consuming
fixes without ever starting (it says so in the log, once per 30 s).

The same idea runs in the other direction: if every fix over
`opt.gnss_stop_dwell_sec` (default 10 s) is worse than the exit gate
(`opt.gnss_stop_max_*`, default 5 m horizontal / 7 m vertical position
and 0.4 m/s horizontal / 0.5 m/s vertical velocity), the filter gives up
the 3D solution - it stops rather than coasting on: it re-arms
into the collecting state, so `ins_get_position_local()` and friends
report nothing at all instead of a position that keeps drifting off bad
fixes. Coming back is a full re-bootstrap through the entry gate, with
the IMU biases carried over at an inflated uncertainty and roll/pitch/yaw
re-seeded from the parallel AHRS if you run `nav_suite`.

One more thing your GNSS receiver does not tell you: how much its reported
position and velocity have in common. They come out of one internally
coupled solution, but the correlation between them is not in any common
output message, so fusing both blocks every epoch counts the same
information twice and leaves the filter more confident than the data
warrants. `opt.gnss_pos_decimation` spends only one of them per epoch:
every Nth epoch that offers both fuses the position, the rest fuse the
velocity alone. Set it to 1 if you want a combined fuse.

## Starting without GNSS: lighthouse / UWB / mocap

You do not need GNSS. Any system that reports a local NED position -
SteamVR lighthouse, UWB, a motion-capture rig, even a total station can aid
the filter through `local_pos` instead. You still give a *coarse* Earth
anchor at init (`llh`), but only so the filter knows the local gravity
and where true north is, it is never used as an aiding measurement.

The only change from the example above is what you put in the measurement
each epoch:

```c
/* A 10 Hz indoor tracker reporting position in the filter's local NED
 * frame (origin = the position you gave at init). 1 cm 1-sigma per axis. */
if (k % 10 == 0) {
    m.local_pos.is_valid   = true;
    m.local_pos.pos_ned[0] = 1.5f;  /* north [m] */
    m.local_pos.pos_ned[1] = 0.0f;  /* east  [m] */
    m.local_pos.pos_ned[2] = 0.0f;  /* down  [m] */
    m.local_pos.Qll_ned[0] = 0.01f * 0.01f;
    m.local_pos.Qll_ned[4] = 0.01f * 0.01f;
    m.local_pos.Qll_ned[8] = 0.01f * 0.01f;
}
```

Read the local position back with `ins_get_position_local(&ins, pos_ned)`.
Aligning the tracker's own coordinate frame with the filter's NED frame
(origin offset + rotation) is your responsibility - INSLIB assumes the
`pos_ned` you hand it is already in its frame.

## Adding more sensors

The same `ins_measurements_t` carries everything, flip on the fields you
have:

* **`m.gnss_vel`** - a GNSS velocity in NED (with its own covariance).
  Velocity aiding is what makes the heading observable while moving.
* **`m.mag`** - a magnetometer sample. Call
  `ins_set_magnetic_model_from_position(&ins, lat, lon, year)` once (e.g.
  on your first fix) so yaw is referenced to **true** north via the World
  Magnetic Model. Leave `m.mag.Qll_diag` at zero unless you have
  characterised the sensor *on your platform*: the filter then uses its
  own noise default, which is deliberately weak (roughly the horizontal
  field itself, so about a radian of heading per sample), and throttles
  the fusion to 1 Hz (`opt.magnetometer_min_delay_ms`). The magnetometer
  is meant to keep yaw from drifting away over minutes, not to steer it
  every epoch - the gyro is better at that, and the field near motors
  and steel is not as good as its noise figure suggests. A hard-iron
  offset is a different problem: no variance fixes it, only
  `opt.mag_fixed_bias` / `opt.estimate_mag_bias` do.
* **`m.yaw`** - an absolute heading in **radians** (dual-antenna GNSS,
  mocap pose, gyro compass). Either convention works, `[-pi, pi]` or
  `[0, 2*pi)`, the filter normalises it. A value beyond one full turn is
  taken as a unit or unwrapping mistake (degrees in a radian field, an
  accumulated course), dropped, and counted in `n_invalid_input`. If
  the heading aiding does nothing, check that counter first. A
  dual-antenna receiver measures the azimuth of its antenna baseline,
  which is the yaw only for antennas lined up along the body x axis. For
  any other mounting convert it first with
  `ins_yaw_from_baseline_heading(heading, roll, pitch, baseline_b, &yaw)`
  (`geodetic_toolbox.h`), using the attitude you currently have.
* **`m.zero_velocity_update` / `m.zero_rotation_update`** - tell the
  filter you know you are standing still, it re-estimates its IMU biases.
  (An automatic detector does this by default.)
* **`m.gnss_delay_ms`, `m.local_pos_delay_ms`, `m.yaw_delay_ms`** - if a
  fix is a known number of milliseconds old (latency) the filter anchors
  the correction at the right point in its state history. This is essential
  for agile vehicles.

Every field is documented in `src/ins.h` - this header is the reference
for the whole API.

## Calibrating your IMU (no fixture needed)

A cheap MEMS IMU straight out of the box has bias, scale factor and axis
misalignment errors that the filter can only partly estimate on its own,
and a magnetometer is off by hard and soft iron. INSLIB includes a
calibration tool that measures all of it without a turntable or a
calibration rig, from one recording of your own sensor:

1. Leave the unit completely still for about 20 s.
2. Then pick it up, turn it to a new attitude (any, it does not have to be
   level), put it down and hold it for a few seconds. Repeat 20 to 30
   times.
3. Log this as `imu.csv` (`t_us, gyr xyz [rad/s], acc xyz [m/s^2]`) and,
   if you have one, `mag.csv` (`t_us, mag xyz [uT]`), FRD axes, one clock.

```sh
python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --csv mysession/ -o config.yaml
```

The result lands in `config.yaml` as column-major 3x3 matrices and bias
vectors in exactly the model the filter applies,
`corrected = M * (raw - fixed_bias)`. Copy them into
`opt.imu_acc_misalignment`, `opt.imu_gyr_misalignment`,
`opt.imu_acc_fixed_bias`, `opt.imu_gyr_fixed_bias` and, for the
magnetometer, `opt.mag_misalignment` / `opt.mag_fixed_bias`. The CSV
path works with any IMU.

## Beyond the bare filter: `nav_suite`

`ins` alone drops its position solution during a long GNSS outage. The
`nav_suite` wrapper (see `src/nav_suite.h`) runs `ins` **plus** two
attitude-only filters (ARS/AHRS) and a barometric vertical channel in parallel,
and arbitrates the best available answer: `FULL` -> `COASTING` ->
`ATTITUDE_ONLY` -> `NONE`. If you want graceful degradation out of the box,
start there, the measurement struct and conventions are identical.

## Where to look next

* `src/ins.h` - every option, measurement field and accessor, documented.
* `src/nav_suite.h` - the "best available solution" wrapper.
* `tests/test_ins_core.c` - dozens of small, readable usage scenarios.
* `python_tutorial.md` - the same library from Python in a few lines.
