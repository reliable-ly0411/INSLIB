# INSLIB in Python

The same navigation filter you get in C is available as a small Python
package, `INSLIB`. It is a thin `ctypes` binding over the compiled library
plus some conveniences (telemetry to PlotJuggler / MAVLink, a YAML CSV
runner). This tutorial shows how little code it takes to get a solution.

If you have not read it yet, the concepts (frames, states, the "feed
measurements, read a solution" loop) are introduced in the companion
`c_tutorial.md`. Here we focus on the Python surface.

## Install

Today the package installs as an **editable** install against a prebuilt
shared library:

```sh
make pylib               # builds python/INSLIB/libINSLIB.so
pip install -e python/   # now `import INSLIB` works anywhere
```

**Is `pip install INSLIB` coming?** Yes, that is the intended end state.
The packaging is already in place (`python/pyproject.toml`), and because
the binding is `ctypes` over a flat C ABI, a released wheel is *one wheel
per platform*, not per Python version. The remaining piece is a build
backend that compiles the C sources into the wheel. Until then, the
`make pylib` + editable-install path above is the supported way.

You need Python 3.8 or newer and a C compiler for `make pylib`. Everything in
this tutorial uses only the standard library plus `INSLIB`.

## Your first script

`Navigator` is the high-level entry point: push whatever sensors you have
each epoch, then read a unified `Solution`. Here is the Python twin of the
C tutorial's first program: a stationary IMU at 100 Hz with a
once-per-second GNSS fix:

```python
import math
from INSLIB import Navigator, Config

D2R = math.pi / 180.0

# The (stationary) location: a spot in Munich, 520 m ellipsoidal.
lat, lon, h = 48.1372 * D2R, 11.5756 * D2R, 520.0

nav = Navigator(Config(auto_init=True))

dt = 0.01                                  # 100 Hz
for k in range(1, 1201):                   # 12 s: the 3D entry dwell is 5 s
    t_us = int(k * dt * 1e6)
    nav.imu(t_us, dt, acc=(0.0, 0.0, -9.81), gyr=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
    if k % 100 == 0:                       # a 1 Hz GNSS fix
        # As the receiver reports it. 2 m stddev per axis -> variance 4.
        # The vertical one has to stay inside the 3D entry gate (3 m),
        # otherwise the filter keeps the solution at ATTITUDE_ONLY.
        nav.gnss_pos_llh((lat, lon, h), var_ned=(4.0, 4.0, 4.0))
    nav.update()                           # run the filter for this epoch
    sol = nav.solution()                   # read the result back

print("mode:", sol.mode, " ready:", sol.ready)
print("lat %.6f deg  lon %.6f deg  h %.1f m"
      % (sol.lat_rad / D2R, sol.lon_rad / D2R, sol.alt_m))
print("rpy  %.2f  %.2f  %.2f deg"
      % (sol.roll / D2R, sol.pitch / D2R, sol.yaw / D2R))
```

Run it:

```sh
python3 hello.py
```

Expected output:

```
mode: FULL  ready: True
lat 48.137200 deg  lon 11.575600 deg  h 520.0 m
rpy  -0.00  0.00  0.00 deg
```

## The per-epoch loop, in three moves

```python
nav.imu(t_us, dt, acc, gyr)      # 1. begin the epoch with the IMU sample
nav.gnss_pos_llh(llh, var_ned)   #    add whatever aiding you have this epoch
nav.update()                  # 2. run the filter
sol = nav.solution()          # 3. read the result
```

> **The one gotcha:** `nav.solution()` (and `nav.state()`, `nav.rpy()`, ...) are
> *readers*. They do not run the filter. You must call **`nav.update()`
> first** each epoch, after pushing the sensors. Forget it and the
> solution never leaves `mode=NONE`.

Add only the sensors you have, each is a one-liner:

```python
nav.imu(t_us, dt, acc, gyr)              # begins an epoch (var args optional)
nav.gnss_pos_llh(llh, var_ned)           # lat/lon/height fix + NED covariance
nav.gnss_pos_llh(llh, var_ned, delay_ms=80) # ...or a late fix (80 ms, history-anchored)
nav.gnss_vel(vel_ned, var_ned)           # NED velocity
nav.mag(mag_uT, mag_var)                 # magnetometer
nav.baro(pressure_pa)                    # static pressure -> vertical channel
nav.yaw(yaw_rad, stddev_rad)             # absolute heading (e.g. dual-antenna, pose)
nav.local_pos(pos_ned, var_ned)          # Lighthouse / UWB / mocap
nav.zupt(True); nav.zaru(True)           # known standstill / clamp
```

`var_ned` is either a 3-element NED variance diagonal (as above) or a full
3×3 covariance (nested rows or flat row-major length 9).

`nav.yaw()` takes **radians** in either convention, `[-pi, pi]` or
`[0, 2*pi)`. A heading beyond one full turn is treated as a unit or
unwrapping mistake, dropped, and counted in the filter's
`n_invalid_input` diagnostic instead of being wrapped into a wrong
heading.

A dual-antenna receiver measures the azimuth of its antenna baseline,
which is the yaw only when the antennas sit along the body x axis. For
any other mounting convert it first:

```python
from INSLIB import yaw_from_baseline_heading
roll, pitch, _ = nav.rpy() or (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
yaw = yaw_from_baseline_heading(heading_rad, roll, pitch, (0.0, 1.0, 0.0))
if yaw is not None:                      # None: baseline near vertical
    nav.yaw(yaw, stddev_rad, delay_ms=200)
```

## Reading the `Solution`

`nav.solution()` returns a `Solution` dataclass:

```python
sol.mode          # "FULL" / "COASTING" / "ATTITUDE_ONLY" / "NONE"
sol.ready         # position/velocity usable?
sol.roll, sol.pitch, sol.yaw     # best-available attitude [rad]
sol.pos_ecef, sol.pos_local      # WGS84 ECEF [m], local NED [m]
sol.vel_ned                      # NED velocity [m/s]
sol.lat_rad, sol.lon_rad, sol.alt_m
sol.height_m       # best height above the datum (ins, else baro)
sol.height_ell_m   # best absolute (ellipsoid) height
```

The mode tells you how good the answer is right now. `Navigator` degrades
gracefully: with fresh GNSS you get `FULL`, through an outage it `COASTING`s
on the IMU, if position is lost entirely, `ATTITUDE_ONLY` still gives you
roll/pitch/yaw from the attitude-only (AHRS/ARS) fallback.

Reaching `FULL` in the first place takes fixes that are better than merely
fusable: the entry gate (`Config.gnss_start_max_*`) has to
hold for `gnss_init_dwell_sec`. Raise those if your receiver reports a
coarser accuracy, otherwise the filter never leaves `ATTITUDE_ONLY` (the
log says so once per 30 s). The reverse holds too: if every fix for
`gnss_stop_dwell_sec` is worse than the exit gate
(`gnss_stop_max_*`), the mode drops back to
`ATTITUDE_ONLY` and the filter stops - `pos_local`
and `pos_ecef` go `None`, so nothing keeps drifting off bad fixes. Only a
full re-bootstrap through the entry gate brings `FULL` back, carrying the
IMU biases over at an inflated uncertainty and re-seeding attitude from
the AHRS. Set `gnss_stop_disable=True` to switch the exit off entirely, or
`auto_reacquire_disable=True` to keep the filter running and merely have
`ready` go false.

## Starting without GNSS: Lighthouse / UWB / mocap

No GNSS? Aid the filter with a local NED position instead. Give the lab's
coarse location once in the `Config` (for gravity and true north only, not
as an aiding measurement), then push `local_pos` each epoch:

```python
import math
from INSLIB import Navigator, Config

D2R = math.pi / 180.0

# Coarse lab anchor - gravity + north reference, not an aiding fix.
nav = Navigator(Config(auto_init=True,
                       lat_rad=48.1372 * D2R, lon_rad=11.5756 * D2R,
                       h_m=520.0))

dt = 0.01
for k in range(1, 601):
    nav.imu(int(k * dt * 1e6), dt, acc=(0.0, 0.0, -9.81), gyr=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
    if k % 10 == 0:                        # a 10 Hz indoor tracker
        nav.local_pos((1.5, 0.0, 0.0), var_ned=(1e-4, 1e-4, 1e-4))  # 1 cm
    nav.update()
    sol = nav.solution()

print(sol.mode, sol.ready, tuple(round(x, 3) for x in sol.pos_local))
# -> FULL True (1.5, -0.0, -0.0)
```

The position you pass must already be in the filter's NED frame (origin =
the `Config` lat/lon/h). Aligning your tracker's frame to it is up to you.

## Referencing yaw to true north (magnetometer)

If you have a magnetometer, arm the World Magnetic Model once (e.g. on the
first coarse position) so estimated yaw is relative to true north and the
magnetic-disturbance gate is active:

```python
nav.set_magnetic_model(lat_rad, lon_rad, 2026.5)   # decimal year
...
nav.mag(mag_uT, (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))   # per-axis variance, 0 -> library default
```

Pass zeros for the variance unless you have characterised the sensor *on
the target platform*. The library's own default is deliberately weak
and the fusion is throttled to 1 Hz (`Config(magnetometer_min_delay_ms=...)`,
negative switches the throttle off). The magnetometer is there to keep yaw from
drifting away over minutes, over seconds the gyro is the better instrument.

## Calibrating your IMU (no fixture needed)

Bias, scale factor and axis misalignment of a cheap MEMS IMU, and hard and
soft iron of a magnetometer, can be measured from one recording of your
own sensor, without a turntable: leave the unit still for about 20 s, then
put it down in 20 to 30 different attitudes (any, not necessarily level)
for a few seconds each. Log that as `imu.csv` (`t_us, gyr xyz [rad/s],
acc xyz [m/s^2]`) and optionally `mag.csv` (`t_us, mag xyz [uT]`), FRD
axes, one clock, and run

```sh
python3 tools/inslib_imu_calib.py --csv mysession/ -o config.yaml
```

The keys it writes map one to one onto `Config`, same model
`corrected = M * (raw - fixed_bias)`, column-major 3x3:

```python
cfg = Config(imu_acc_misalignment=(...), imu_acc_fixed_bias=(...),
             imu_gyr_misalignment=(...), imu_gyr_fixed_bias=(...),
             mag_misalignment=(...), mag_fixed_bias=(...))
```

`python/replay.py` reads the `config.yaml` directly. In a `python -m INSLIB`
run file the same values go under `filter:` with the `Config` names
(`imu_acc_misalignment: [...]` and so on).

## The lean alternative: `Ins`

If you do not need the AHRS/baro fallback, `Ins` is the bare 15-state ESKF
the same three-move loop, a little leaner. Note it uses `update()` and
then plain accessors rather than a `Solution`:

```python
from INSLIB import Ins, Config

nav = Ins(Config(auto_init=True))
nav.imu(t_us, dt, acc, gyr)
nav.gnss_pos_llh((lat, lon, h), var_ned=(4.0, 4.0, 4.0))
nav.update()
print(nav.rpy(), nav.is_ready(), nav.position_local(), nav.position_llh())
```

Conventions match the C library exactly: body frame FRD, nav frame NED,
Hamilton quaternion `q = [w, x, y, z]`, time in `int64` microseconds,
angles in radians.

## Watching it live

`INSLIB` can stream the estimate straight into
[PlotJuggler](https://plotjuggler.io) (UDP/JSON) and to any MAVLink GCS:

```python
from INSLIB import Telemetry
tele = Telemetry(plotjuggler=True, mavlink=False)
...
nav.update(); tele.publish(nav.state())
```

For a full end-to-end demo against a real dataset (with a suggested
PlotJuggler layout), see `python/DEMO.md`. To run your own CSV logs
without writing any code at all, there is a YAML-configured runner:

```sh
python3 -m INSLIB myrun.yaml        # or: inslib-run myrun.yaml
```

See `python/README.md` and `python/examples/runner.yaml` for that path.
